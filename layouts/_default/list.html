    <p>
      Thanks for checking out my portfolio. I am a wife, mom, and career transitioner. I make a living as a website
      developer and application designer. My technical speciality is in the realm of UI design and engineering. I love
      making then taking an idea from Figma to the digital screen with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I have fun creating
      youtube videos for my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@dancedeja" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dance</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@lowpolyprincess" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coding </a>channels respectively, as well as participating in game jams and meetups.

      Yes, I am one of those unicorns who can Code and Design. All of the projects in this portfolio are original
      designs and coding endeavors. Don't be fooled, I have years of experience working on small and medium sized teams.
      Teamwork makes the dream work.
    </p>
    <p>

      I graduated from art school (where I learned web development) and went on to teach movement and wellness classes
      in New York and New Jersey. In 2019 I decided to settle down in Georgia and get serious about freelancing as a
      generalist designer, developer, and writer. I realized my passion was working with startups and small businesses
      as a team member that would wear many hats while helping the brand polish and refine their voice through behind
      the scenes work and direct interactions with customers and clients.
